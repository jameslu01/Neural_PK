- `pytorch 1.5.1` doesn't seem to exist anymore. You can do the following:
```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
conda create --name neuralpk python=3.7.5
conda activate neuralpk
conda install pytorch==1.5 scipy==1.7.3 torchdiffeq==0.2.2 pandas==1.3.5 scikit-learn==1.0.2 jupyterlab
``` 
- For now, just using CPU but will need to figure out GPU stuff at the end.
- Data has the following columns:
  - STUD - Study ID. Can be 1000, 2000, 3000.
  - PTNM - Patient number. Can be repeated between studies, but for example patient 1 in Study 1000 is not the same person as patient 1 in study 2000.
  - DSFQ - Dosage frequency is how often the dose is administred. Only 1 or 3.
  - AMT - Dosage amount. Can be 0 when measurements taken between doses.
  - TIME - Time since beginning of patient's treatment.
  - TFDS - Time since dose.
  - DV - Concentration measurement.
